#Input: 
       
       Creating an array i.e, a[][] of size 10 for row as well as column.
       
#Logic: 

     Here we create an array of same size,moving further using for loop statement initializing two  variable i.e, i and j for printing  row and column respectively.
     * In first loop, which is for row  wise operation, where i is equal to zero, i is less than 10 and increament in i.
     * In second loop, which is for column operation, where j is equal to zero,j is less than 10 and increament in j.
     * print the pattern.
