## TASK: Given an integer, N , print its first 10 multiples. Each multiple N X i (where )1<=i<=10 should be printed on a new line in the form: N x i = result.

###using java.

### Input Format: A single integer, N .

### Constraints: 2<= N <=20

### Output Format: Print 10 lines of output; each line i (where )1<=i<=10 contains the result  of N X i  in the form: N x i = result N x i = result.

## TEST CASES: 
            Sample case 1: for N=2,
           
            Sample case 2: for N=7,
           
            Sample case 3: for N=19,
           
### LOGIC: 
        --> First take positive integer from user i.e, N.
        --> Using "for loop" statement initialize i, where i is equals to 1 and i is less than equals to 10,now incrementing i.
        --> To store the value of i, initialize new variable named "result".(result= N x i).
        --> Print the results.
