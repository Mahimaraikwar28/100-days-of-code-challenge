Problem: Implementing basic calculator using java  programming language.
INPUT: integers ch;
       double a,b;
 where "a" and" b" are the two values of double type,storing some values in it for performing basic calculation operation.
  "ch" is the integer type variable used for enter the choice of user.
  
 Test cases: using switch statement,
              Let user will enter a=2 and b=3.
                
            CASE 1: performing Addition,
            
            i.e, (a + b) : 2 + 3 = 5
            
            CASE 2: performing substraction,
            
            i.e, (a - b) : 2 - 3 = -1
            
            CASE 3: performing multiplication,
            
            i.e, (a * b) : 2 * 3 = 6
            
            Case 4: performing modulus,
            
            i.e, (a % b) : 2 % 3 = 2.0
            
            CASE 5: performing division,
            
            i.e, (a / b) : 2 / 3 = 0.6666666666666666
            
            DEFAULT CASE: If user entered wrong choice,it will print " wrong choice"

LOGIC:  Here the following problem is solving using switch statement, where first taking two input from user that is "a" and "b",
        and now taking choice from user .
        using switch cases first enter user's choice than access that choosed case and perform operation accordingdly.
        
        
OUTPUT:
